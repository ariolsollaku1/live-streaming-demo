Back then, many people wanted to\nstart a new life in an English colony. At the\ntime there were five English colonies in\nNorth America.\nBy 1750, there were thirteen English colonies\non the East Coast of what became the United\nStates. All of them were strong and growing.\nAlmost every week, a ship arrived with more immigrants. The\npopulation of the colonies had already passed one million and was\nquickly climbing toward two million. Settlements had spread from\nthe Atlantic Ocean to as far west as the Appalachian Mountains.\n2\nThe Big Question\nIn what ways did the\ncolonies change over\ntime?\nVocabulary\nimmigrant, n. a\nperson from one\ncountry who moves to\nanother country to live\ncolony, n. an area,\nregion, or country\nthat is controlled and\nsettled by people\nfrom another country\n3\nImmigrants by the hundreds arrived in the American colonies in the 1700s.\n4\nWhy had so many people come to the British colonies in North\nAmerica? Why were so many still coming in 1750? The answer is simply\nopportunity: the opportunity to own land of their own, the opportunity\nto work in the growing towns and cities, the opportunity to worship as\nthey pleased, the opportunity to escape the past and start a new life.\nWho were these colonists? Where were they from? They were\nmainly ordinary peopleâ€”farmers and people from small towns.\nMost colonists were from England, but a large numberâ€”almost\na thirdâ€”came from Germany. Many others came from Scotland,\nIreland, Wales, Sweden, and the Netherlands.\nNot all of those who migrated to the\ncolonies traveled willingly. About one\nperson in five was enslaved, having been\nforcefully removed from his or her home in\nAfrica. Most eventually found themselves in\nthe South, but there were enslaved people in the North, too. Almost\nnone of the people who came from Africa were free.\nLife in the Colonies\nMore than nine out of ten colonial families lived on farms. They\nfarmed their land by themselves. Every member of the family had\na job to do. As a result, they produced nearly everything they\nneeded to survive. They raised their own food. They made their\nown clothes and their own tools. They made their own furniture.\nMost of them even built the houses that they lived in. When the\nweather and the harvest were good, farmers sometimes had\nenough food left over to sell.\nVocabulary\nmigrate, v. to move\nfrom one place to\nanother to live\nColonists made almost everything they needed for themselves.\n5\nIn the mid-1700s, there were still only four or five cities in all of\nthe colonies, and just a handful of towns. These cities were small\nby todayâ€™s standards, but they were growing quickly. In just a few\nshort years, Philadelphia would become the second-largest city in\nthe whole British Empire next to London, England.\nWhat sparked this growth of towns and cities? Trade within the\ncolonies and with other countries was the driving factor. From\nthe docks of the cities on the East Coast,\nmerchants sent lumber, fur, salted fish,\nflour, rice, indigo, and tobacco to many\nparts of the world. To those docks, ships\nreturned with glass, paint, tea, wine,\nand other goods the colonists needed\nor wanted.\nVocabulary\ntrade, n. the\nexchange or sale of\ngoods or services.\nmerchant, n. a\nperson who sells or\ntrades goods\n6\nTrade also meant jobs. Men loaded and unloaded ships. They built\nboats. They made sails, rope, and barrels for shipping goods. The\ncities and towns offered other kinds of work, too. Men, and some\nwomen, ran stores and shops. Skilled workers baked bread and\nmade pots and pans. Others printed newspapers or made fine\nshoes and clothes for other city dwellers.\nStaying Apart and Coming Together\nWhen immigrants arrived in the colonies, they preferred to settle\nnear people who were from the same country. This made them\nfeel more comfortable in a strange, new land. They could speak\ntheir own language and follow their own traditional ways of life.\nThey wore the same kinds of clothing they had worn in their\nhomeland and built the same kinds of houses.\nIn time, however, something interesting and\nimportant happened. Immigrant groups\nbegan to borrow ideas and customs from\neach other. For example, consider the log\ncabin. Swedes had built log cabins in their\nhomeland. In the colonies, they found plenty\nof trees that could be used to build homes.\nA log cabin was easy to build. Two strong\nsettlers with axes could build one in a couple\nof weeks. Other groups came to North America with their own ideas\nof how to build a house. When they saw the log cabins built by\nSwedish settlers, they realized that these homes were perfect for life\non the frontier. Soon settlers from many different countries built log\ncabins like the ones built by the Swedes.\nVocabulary\ncustom, n. a\ntraditional way of\nacting or doing\nsomething\nfrontier, n. where\nnewly settled areas\nadjoin unsettled areas\nor the wilderness\nA log cabin could make a snug home for a frontier family.\n7\nThis borrowing of ideas and customs among immigrant groups\neven changed the way colonists spoke. Most colonists spoke\nEnglish, but English speakers began to borrow words from the\nother languages spoken in the colonies. They borrowed the words\nnoodle and pretzel from German. They borrowed the words waffle,\ncookie, and sleigh from Dutch. The words pecan, moccasin, skunk,\nand squash came from Native American languages. Words such as\nyams, banjo, and tote came from African languages.\nThe use of words borrowed from other languages created a\nnew form of English that would eventually be called American\nEnglish. Little by little, this new American English became the\nlanguage of the children and grandchildren of immigrants from\nother lands.\n8\nBetter Roads\nBy the 1750s, the colonists were also being brought together by\nimproved roads. These roads were not very good compared to our\nown. They were narrow, often muddy, and filled with tree stumps.\nStill, they were better than the roads of fifty or a hundred years\nearlier. These roads made it easier to travel through the colonies.\nEasier travel led to increased trade among the colonies.\nBetter roads also improved communications by speeding up the\nexchange of information. In the mid-1750s, mail delivery between\nPhiladelphia and Boston increased to once a week instead of every\ntwo weeks. That meant that newspapers printed in the cities could\nbe delivered to colonists in the countryside more easily. Colonists\ncould now read the same news and stay informed about the\nsame things.\nIn all these ways, colonists of many different backgrounds were\nstarting to come together. They were beginningâ€”just beginning,\nof courseâ€”to have more things in common. This coming together\nsoon became very important.\n9\nBy the mid-1700s, English colonies covered much of eastern North America."
