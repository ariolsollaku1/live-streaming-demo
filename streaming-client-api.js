These problems include the lack of easy access primarily to wealth-management institutions like investment funds, which leads to people choosing much riskier alternatives that lead to them loosing their money,  That is just an examples where lack of advanced and hi-tech digital access to wealth insitutions leads to negative value to the average person. \nFrom an institution side, the problem is that these financial companies dont have easy means of how to become user centric, to do it requires a number of different service providers working in union, which just increases costs and lowers the chance of a intuitive design as complexity increases. The problem institutions also face is the increasing rise of insure-tech wealth-tech, trading apps, and similar, that take a very significant market share from them and slowly position themselves as serious competitors.\n\n\nHow have these problems been addressed (or not addressed) in the past? \n\nThe traditional financial institutions especially in south-eastern europe are the once that dont feel hurry to focus on user centric solutions for their clients.And due to conservative management this problem has largely stayed ignored.\n\nWhy are current solutions inadequate?\nFirst the institutions themselves almost never have the necessary talent to digitize them sselv up to the latest trading, and when financial institutions go to developing companies and ask them to create this suite of solutions for them, usually the price is very high and it takes a lot of time.
