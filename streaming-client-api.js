Bank Guarantees\n\nWe understand the importance of secure and regulated partnership relations with your business partners both domestically and abroad. Therefore, we offer you the opportunity to use various types of bank guarantees that will significantly facilitate your dealings with your suppliers and clients, and will accelerate and guarantee the process of payment, delivery, and quality.\n\nWhat is a bank guarantee?\n\nA bank guarantee is a tool that can help you ensure timely payment for goods/services or the proper fulfillment of contractual obligations.\nWhat if the contractual party fails to meet the terms of the contract?\n\nThe beneficiary of the guarantee is protected from non-fulfillment of the agreed obligations (payment or service delivery). In the event that the buyer fails to fulfill the contractual obligations, ProCredit Bank will make the payment upon the first request of the beneficiary and upon presentation of the documents specified in the text of the guarantee. If the conditions are met, payments by the bank are made within 5 (five) business days.\nThe guarantor is protected from unjustified activation of the guarantee. If the beneficiary of the guarantee does not deliver the goods or service according to the contractual terms, they will not be able to provide the documents confirming the delivery, quality, or quantity of the delivered goods or service, and thus there will be no obligation to pay for the goods or service.\nDoes ProCredit Bank have an international rating from an official rating agency?\nProCredit Bank is the only bank in the Republic of North Macedonia that is rated by Fitch Ratings with a credit rating of BBB- with a stable outlook. You can provide this international rating confirmation to your partners both domestically and abroad. ProCredit Bank AD Skopje is the only bank in the market that possesses an international credit rating from the Fitch Ratings agency and still has the highest rating that a company can have within North Macedonia.\n13. Letters of Credit\n\nWe understand that for your import and export of goods and services, secure and timely delivery, as well as prompt payment from your foreign business partners, are crucial. Therefore, we offer you the opportunity to use letters of credit, which will significantly increase the security of your business relationship and facilitate your dealings with your suppliers and clients. ProCredit Bank guarantees the payment process, which is of particular importance for every business.\n\nWhat is a letter of credit?\n\nA letter of credit can assist you in securing payment for goods/services. It is a written commitment to pay a specified sum to the seller (beneficiary) of the letter of credit once the conditions of the letter of credit are met.\nTo ensure these conditions, the beneficiary must present predefined documents to the nominated bank as proof that the goods have been delivered within a precisely determined time frame and in a manner specified in the letter of credit.\nDoes ProCredit Bank have an international rating from an official rating agency?\n\nProCredit Bank is the only bank in the Republic of North Macedonia that is rated by Fitch Ratings with a credit rating of BBB- with a stable development trend. You can provide this international rating confirmation to your partners both domestically and abroad.\n14. Documentary Collections (Incasso)\n\nWe understand that for your import and export of goods, you need a straightforward instrument for securing safe delivery or payment from your foreign business partners. Therefore, we offer you the opportunity to use documentary collections (incasso), which will increase the security of your business relationship and facilitate your dealings with your suppliers and clients.\n\nWhat is a documentary collection (incasso)?\n\nDocumentary collection can assist you in ensuring the quality, quantity, and payment of goods. It is a set of documents with content previously agreed upon between the contracting parties, which the exporter's bank sends to the importer's bank.\nDocumentary collection is a direct and economical payment process that offers a certain degree of protection, such as correctness, quality, quantity, and method of delivery, depending on the content of the sent documents.\n\n15. Forfaiting\n\nWe understand that being an exporter in Macedonia is challenging. For your export of goods, you need an instrument that will allow you to convert a transaction from deferred payment into a cash transaction. Therefore, we offer you the opportunity to use forfaiting, which will increase the competitiveness of your goods abroad.\n\nWhat is forfaiting?\n\nForfaiting (discounting) of a letter of credit involves the purchase of a trade receivable resulting from the export of goods and services, with payment made by the forfaiting bank (the bank of the letter of credit beneficiary) on a future (agreed) date.\nThe purchase of the receivable is without recourse, and the exporter (seller of the goods) receives the funds reduced by the interest of the forfaiting bank (the bank of the letter of credit beneficiary).\n\n16.

Government securities and bonds are issued and paid in denars, in electronic form, at face value, but are paid at a discounted value.\nWho can subscribe to government securities and bonds?\nAll legal and physical persons, residents and non-residents, can subscribe to government securities and bonds through domestic banks. The face value of government securities and bonds is 10,000 denars. Important note for non-residents: non-resident legal and physical persons who wish to participate in the auction must first register with the Central Securities Depository.\nWhat is the price of government securities and bonds?\nFunds invested in government securities and bonds carry a fixed interest, the level of which varies depending on market conditions. The client determines the amount of the price (interest) with which they will bid. The commission of ProCredit Bank for this service is in accordance with the official tariff of the bank.\nWhat is the procedure for subscribing to government securities and bonds?\nBefore the auction day\nThe Ministry of Finance publishes an auction calendar. ProCredit Bank displays the calendar and the prospectus (offer) for the auctions of government securities and bonds, which the Ministry of Finance publishes 4 working days before the auction day, in its premises. ProCredit Bank clients who wish to participate in the auction fill out a request for subscribing to government securities and bonds (form PZ3) immediately after the prospectus is displayed in the bank's premises, but no later than the end of the bank's working hours on the day before the auction day. In the request, in addition to basic data, the client specifies the amounts and prices with which they wish to bid. The client can bid with several amounts at different prices. The responsible for banking operations calculates the discounted amounts according to the data specified in the request. Then the client pays the total discounted amount (if bidding with multiple amounts) and signs the PZ3 form.\nOn the day of the auction\nThe auction of government securities and bonds is held according to the published calendar, between 11:00 and 12:00 hours. The results of the auction are published by the NBRM between 13:00 and 13:30 hours, after which ProCredit Bank immediately informs its clients about the outcome.\nThe day after the auction\nThe Central Securities Depository registers all subscribed government securities and bonds. One day after the auction day, the Central Depository informs the holders of PZ3 about the acquisition of ownership.\nWhat happens on the maturity date?\nOn the maturity date, ProCredit Bank credits the client's account with the nominal amount of the subscribed notes, reduced by the commission (from point 3.).`
