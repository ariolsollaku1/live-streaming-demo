The vineyard is located in the Ovchka River region. The harvested grapes are macerated for two days. Fermentation lasts for 18 days at a controlled temperature of 16Â°C. It matures in stainless steel tanks for 3 months on fine lees. This dry wine has 14.1% alcohol and a great freshness that lingers in the mouth. It exhibits aromas of southern fruits typical for the variety. It is unfiltered wine.\nLimited production of 1200 bottles.\nSediment is a common occurrence. Contains sulfites.\nVranec - Harvest 2021\n\nDescription: The vineyards are located in the area of Golem Rid in the territory of the village of Marena, Kavadarci, at an altitude of 330 meters. They were planted in 1978. The presence of wild weeds and plants in the vineyards enables the synthesis of a high percentage of sugar even in less favorable years. This semi-dry wine has 16.1% alcohol and a high residual sugar content, but also surprisingly high acidity.\nOn the palate, it is strong, fruity, and aromatic, with an intensity of ripe fruits. Our Vranec is not matured in oak barrels, which allows the true varietal aromas and flavors to come through without masking any of its imperfections. It is aged for one year in stainless steel tanks. Produced in a batch of around 1600 bottles.\nSediment is a common occurrence. The wine contains sulfites.\nCertified organic vineyard.\nNaumchev Winery - also from Tikves Region with Red Wine Vranec and White WineTemjanika\n\nAbout finq up - Turning Financial Institutions to modern fintechs\n\nProblems Solved:\n\nDescription: finq up addresses the lack of user-centric, advanced, hi-tech, innovative, and modern digital solutions for traditional financial institutions in South Eastern Europe and worldwide.
