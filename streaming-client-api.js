Read on to find out how this\nrelates to the core concepts of economics.\nHave you ever noticed that very few\npeople are satisfied with the things they\nhave? For example, someone without a\nhome may want a small one; someone else\nwith a small home may want a larger one;\nsomeone with a large home may want a\nmansion. Whether they are rich or poor,\nmost people seem to want more than they\nalready have. In fact, if each of us were to\nmake a list of all the things we want, it\nwould most likely include more things\nthan we could ever hope to obtain.\nScarcity\nThe fundamental economic problem fac-\ning all societies is that of scarcity. Scarcity\nis the condition that results from society\nnot having enough resources to produce\nall the things people would like to have.\nAs Figure 1.1 shows, scarcity affects almost\nevery decision we make. This is where eco-\nnomics comes in. Economics is the study of\nhow people try to satisfy seemingly unlim-\nited and competing wants through the care-\nful use of relatively scarce resources.\nNeeds and Wants\nEconomists often talk about people‚Äôs\nneeds and wants. A need is a basic require-\nment for survival, such as food, clothing,\nand shelter. A want is simply something we\nwould like to have but is not necessary for\nsurvival. Food, for example, is needed for\nsurvival. Because many foods will satisfy the\nneed for nourishment, the range of things\nrepresented by the term want is much broader\nthan that represented by the term need.\nTINSTAAFL\nBecause resources are limited, every-\nthing we do has a cost‚Äîeven when it seems\nas if we are getting something ‚Äúfor free.‚Äù\nFor example, do you really get a free meal\nwhen you use a ‚Äúbuy one, get one free‚Äù\ncoupon? The business that gives it away\nstill has to pay for the resources that went\ninto the meal, so it usually tries to recover\nthese costs by charging more for its other\nproducts. In the end, you may actually be\nthe one who pays for the ‚Äúfree‚Äù lunch!\nRealistically, most things in life are not\nfree, because someone has to pay for pro-\nducing them in the first place. Economists\nuse the term TINSTAAFL to describe this\nconcept. In short, it means There Is No Such\nThing As A Free Lunch.\nReading Check Contrasting What is the difference\nbetween a need and a want?\nScarcity is the fundamental economic problem that forces consumers\nand producers to use resources wisely.\nEconomic Analysis Why is scarcity a universal problem?\nFigure 1.1 Scarcity\nSCARCITY SCARCITY\nChoices\nFOR WHOM\nto produce\nWHAT\nto produce\nUnlimited\nwants\nUnlimited\nwants\nLimited\nresources\nLimited\nresources\nHOW\nto produce\nCHAPTER 1 What Is Economics? 7\nThree Basic Questions\nMAIN Idea Scarcity forces every society to\nanswer the basic questions of WHAT, HOW, and\nFOR WHOM to produce.\nEconomics & You When you write a report,\nyou usually answer the who, what, when, where, and\nwhy questions. Read on to learn about the three basic\nquestions in economics.\nBecause we live in a world of relatively\nscarce resources, we have to make careful\neconomic choices about the way we use\nthese resources. Figure 1.1 presents three\nbasic questions we need to answer as we\nmake these choices.\nWHAT to Produce\nThe first question is WHAT to produce.\nFor example, should a society direct most of\nits resources to the production of military\nequipment or to other items such as food,\nclothing, or housing? Suppose the decision\nis to produce housing. Should the limited\nresources be used to build low-income,\nmiddle-income, or upper-income housing?\nA society cannot have everything its people\nwant, so it must decide WHAT to produce.\nHOW to Produce\nA second question is HOW to produce.\nShould factory owners use automated pro-\nduction methods that require more machines\nand fewer workers, or should they use fewer\nmachines and more workers? If a commu-\nnity has many unemployed people, using\nmore workers might be better. On the other\nhand, in countries where machinery is\nwidely available, automation can often\nlower production costs. Lower costs make\nmanufactured items less expensive and,\ntherefore, available to more people.\nFOR WHOM to Produce\nThe third question is FOR WHOM to\nproduce. After a society decides WHAT\nand HOW to produce, it must decide who\nwill receive the things produced. If a\nsociety decides to produce housing, for\nexample, should it be the kind of housing\nthat is wanted by low-income workers,\nmiddle-income professional people, or\nthe very rich? If there are not enough\nhouses for everyone, a society has to\nmake a choice about who will receive the\nexisting supply.\nThese questions concerning WHAT,\nHOW, and FOR WHOM to produce are\nnever easy for any society to answer.\nNevertheless, they must be answered as\nlong as there are not enough resources to\nsatisfy people‚Äôs seemingly unlimited wants\nand needs.\nReading Check Analyzing Why are societies\nfaced with the three basic questions of WHAT, HOW,\nand FOR WHOM?\nWHAT to Produce Societies need to decide whether to include parks in\nhousing areas or to produce more housing. How do the three questions help\nsocieties make choices about scarce resources?\nCorbis\n8 UNIT 1 Fundamental Economic Concepts\nThe Factors of\nProduction\nMAIN Idea Four factors of production‚Äîland,\ncapital, labor, and entrepreneurs‚Äîmust be present\nto produce goods and services.\nEconomics & You When you were younger, did\nyou ever sell something or have a paper route to\nmake money? Read on to find out how this relates to\nthe factors of production.\nPeople cannot satisfy all their wants and\nneeds because productive resources are\nscarce. The factors of production, or\nresources required to produce the things\nwe would like to have, are land, capital,\nlabor, and entrepreneurs. As shown in\nFigure 1.2, all four are required to produce\ngoods and services.\nLand\nIn economics, land refers to the ‚Äúgifts of\nnature,‚Äù or natural resources not created by\npeople. ‚ÄúLand‚Äù includes deserts, fertile\nfields, forests, mineral deposits, livestock,\nsunshine, and the climate necessary to grow\ncrops. Because a finite amount of natural\nresources are available at any given time,\neconomists tend to think of land as being\nfixed, or in limited supply.\nCapital\nAnother factor of production is capital,\nsometimes called capital goods‚Äîthe tools,\nequipment, machinery, and factories used in\nthe production of goods and services. Capital\nis unique because it is the result of produc-\ntion. A bulldozer, for example, is a capital\ngood used in construction. When it was built\nin a factory, it was the result of production\ninvolving other capital goods. The computers\nin your school that are used to produce the\nservice of education also are capital goods.\nLabor\nA third factor of production is labor‚Äî\npeople with all their efforts, abilities, and\nskills. This category includes all people except\na unique group of individuals called entre-\npreneurs, whom we single out because of\ntheir special role in the economy. Historically,\nfactors such as birthrates, immigration, fam-\nine, war, and disease have had a dramatic\nimpact on the quantity and quality of labor.\nfactors of\nproduction\nproductive resources\nthat make up the four\ncategories of land,\ncapital, labor, and\nentrepreneurs\nland natural\nresources or other\n‚Äúgifts of nature‚Äù not\ncreated by human\neffort\ncapital or capital\ngoods tools,\nequipment, and\nfactories used in the\nproduction of goods\nand services\nlabor people with all\ntheir efforts, abilities\nand skills\nFigure 1.2 The Factors of Production\nThe four factors of production are necessary for production to take place.\nEconomic Analysis What four factors of production are necessary to bring\nclothing to consumers?\nLand Capital Labor Entrepreneurs\nEntrepreneurs are\nindividuals who start a\nnew business or bring\na product to market.\nLand includes the\n‚Äúgifts of nature,‚Äù or natural\nresources not created by\nhuman effort.\nCapital includes the\ntools, equipment, and\nfactories used in\nproduction.\nLabor includes people\nwith all their efforts\nand abilities.\n(l) Corbis, (cl) Neil Beer/Getty Images, (cr) Sie Productions/Zefa/Corbis, (r) Howard Grey/Getty Images\nCHAPTER 1 What Is Economics? 9\nEntrepreneurs\nSome people are singled out because\nthey are the innovators responsible for\nmuch of the change in our economy. Such\nan individual is an entrepreneur, a risk-\ntaker in search of profits who does some-\nthing new with existing resources.\nEntrepreneurs are often thought of as being\nthe driving force in an economy because\nthey are the people who start new busi-\nnesses or bring new products to market.\nProduction\nEverything we make requires the four\nfactors of production. The desks and lab\nequipment used in schools are capital\ngoods. Teachers and other employees pro-\nvide the labor. Land includes the property\nwhere the school is located as well as the\niron ore and timber used to make the build-\ning. Finally, entrepreneurs are needed to\norganize the other three factors and make\nsure that everything gets done.\nReading Check Interpreting What would happen\nif one of the factors of production was missing?\nThe Scope of Economics\nMAIN Idea Economics analyzes how societies\nsatisfy wants through careful use of relatively\nscarce resources.\nEconomics & You So far, you have learned\nabout the basics of economics. Read on to learn how\neconomists help us make sense of this information.\nEconomics is the study of human efforts\nto satisfy seemingly unlimited and compet-\ning wants through the careful use of rela-\ntively scarce resources. Economics is also a\nsocial science because it deals with the\nbehavior of people as they deal with this\nbasic issue. The four key elements to this\nstudy are description, analysis, explana-\ntion, and prediction.\nDescription\nOne part of economics describes eco-\nnomic activity. For example, we often hear\nabout gross domestic product (GDP)‚Äîthe\ndollar value of all final goods, services, and\nstructures produced within a country‚Äôs\nborders in a 12-month period. GDP is the\nentrepreneur\nrisk-taking individual in\nsearch of profits\ngross domestic\nproduct (GDP)\ndollar value of all final\ngoods, services, and\nstructures produced\nwithin a country‚Äôs\nborders during a\none-year period\nGlobal Entrepreneurs Drive\nthe Economy\nEvery time you get paid for baby-sitting, mowing the\nlawn, or being the deejay at an event, you have joined\nthe ‚Äúforce‚Äù‚Äîthe global entrepreneurial force, that is. A\nvast majority of the more than 20 million businesses in\nthe United States are owned by entrepreneurs. Most\neither work alone or have a few employees.\nUntil recently, the United States led in the percentage\nof adult entrepreneurs, with an estimated 11.3 percent\nof Americans starting a new business each year. Today,\nthe small country of Jordan has just over half a million\nentrepreneurs, but it can boast the highest percentage\nof individuals attempting to go it alone. That‚Äôs nearly\none in every five adults. The bar graph here illustrates\nthe percentage of the adult population in select countries\nwho are starting new businesses.\n&The Global Economy\nYOU\nSource: 2004 Global Entrepeneurship Monitor (GEM) www.gemconsortium.org\nJordan 18.3%\nIsrael 6.6%\nCanada 8.9%\nUnited Kingdom 6.3%\nSingapore 5.7%\nSouth Africa 5.4%\nGermany 4.5%\nJapan 1.5%\nUnited States 11.3%\nBrazil 13.5%\nSkills Handbook\nSee page R50 to\nlearn about Using\nBar Graphs.\n10 UNIT 1 Fundamental Economic Concepts\nReview\nmost comprehensive measure of a coun-\ntry‚Äôs total output and a key measure of a\nnation‚Äôs economic health. Economics also\ndescribes jobs, prices, trade, taxes, and gov-\nernment spending.\nDescription allows us to know what the\nworld looks like. However, description is\nonly part of the picture, because it leaves\nmany important ‚Äúwhy‚Äù and ‚Äúhow‚Äù ques-\ntions unanswered.\nAnalysis\nEconomics analyzes the economic activ-\nity that it describes. Why, for example, are\nthe prices of some items higher than oth-\ners? Why do some people earn higher\nincomes than others? How do taxes affect\npeople‚Äôs desire to work and save?\nAnalysis is important because it helps us\ndiscover why things work and how things\nhappen. This, in turn, will help us deal with\nproblems that we would like to solve.\nExplanation\nEconomics also involves explanation.\nAfter economists analyze a problem and\nunderstand why and how things work,\nthey need to communicate this knowledge\nto others. If we all have a common under-\nstanding of the way our economy works,\nsome economic problems will be easier to\naddress or even fix in the future. When it\ncomes to GDP, you will soon discover that\neconomists spend much of their time\nexplaining why the measure is, or is not,\nperforming in the manner that is expected.\nPrediction\nFinally, economics is concerned with\nprediction. For example, we may want to\nknow whether our incomes will rise or fall\nin the near future. Because economics is the\nstudy of both what is happening and what\ntends to happen, it can help predict what\nmay happen in the future, including the\nmost likely effects of different actions.\nThe study of economics helps us become\nmore informed citizens and better decision\nmakers. Because of this, it is important to\nrealize that good economic choices are the\nresponsibility of all citizens in a free and\ndemocratic society.\nReading Check Explaining Why is economics\nconsidered to be a social science?\nVocabulary\n1. Explain the significance of scarcity, economics, need,\nwant, factors of production, land, capital, capital good,\nlabor, entrepreneur, and Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\nMain Ideas\n2. Identifying What three basic questions must every\nsociety answer, and why?\n3. Organizing Use a graphic organizer similar to the one\nbelow to identify and describe the factors of production.\nFactor Description\nLand\nCritical Thinking\n4. The BIG Idea How can studying economics help us\nmake better choices about how to use scarce resources?\n5. Synthesizing Information Do you pay to drink from the\nwater fountains at school? Explain why the water is not\nreally free by stating who actually pays for it.\n6. Analyzing Visuals Look at Figure 1.2. Identify and\ncategorize the factors of production for a business you\nknow, such as your place of employment. What would\nhappen if one of these factors was no longer available?\nApplying Economics\n7. Scarcity How does scarcity affect your life? Provide\nseveral examples of items you had to do without\nbecause of limited resources, and explain how you\nadjusted to this situation."
